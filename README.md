# hello-world
This is my first github repository and will be in the time-honored style of 'hello world'
//I am a new programmer. I am starting off this new path for myself by learning Javascript.
//I first took an interest in code back in 2013, but never took the time to really learn it. I merely dabbled, but those days are over.
//This will be the first of many really cool projects I will be completing in order to practice what I know so far.
